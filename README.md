# Professional README.MD Generator

## Description

This application allows the user to create a high-quality README for their application that they have created as an open source project on GitHub.   
By providing details regarding their GitHub profile, email address, Project Name along with further details regarding the Project (description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines and test instructions) and picking out which license they would prefer to use; the application will create a professional README.md file.  

My motivation was to build an application that would allow for easy and rapid creation of a README.md  for future projects to be stored in my GitHub repository.  This will allow for consistent README.md files across all my projects.  

Things I learned from this application:
- package.json
- inquirier.prompt and adding values to choices to expand the usable data 
- learned about tying required packages to an application 
- modularization 
- using temperate literals
- using ternary operators
- learning Write - File in javascript
- keeping my code DRY
